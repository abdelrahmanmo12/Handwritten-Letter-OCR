# Handwritten Letter OCR

This project is a handwritten letter recognition system using machine learning and OCR techniques.

## Dataset
- EMNIST (Extended MNIST)

## Features
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction using HOG and PCA
- Classification using:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- GUI application for drawing or uploading handwritten letters
- Confidence score displayed for each model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Tkinter
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application:
python main.py


## Output
The system predicts the handwritten letter using both models and shows confidence percentages.
