# AI Project: Handwritten Letter OCR

## Project Overview
This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for handwritten English letters using feature engineering and machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees and Random Forests).

## Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of handwritten letter images
- Multiple feature extraction methods (HOG, PCA, handcrafted features)
- Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers with comparison
- Interactive GUI for letter recognition
- Comprehensive model evaluation and visualization

## Installation
